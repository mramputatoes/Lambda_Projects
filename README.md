## Lambda_Projects

Repository where I'll keep CSV files and my notebooks for Lambda Portfolio Projects. Each folder is a different project with the associated CSV file and Notebooks.
Everything is run in Jupyter Notebooks, but I have included !pip installs for GoogleColab as well.

## Pokemon 
CSV File from Kaggle.com with associated notebook. Figured out the correlation between Pokemon Capture Rate and other stats.

## Running
CSV File from Kaggle. Regression model to calculate calories burned during a run.
